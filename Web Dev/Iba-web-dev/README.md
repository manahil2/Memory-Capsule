The Memory Capsule Collection is a digital platform designed to help users store, manage, and share their personal memories in the form of memory capsules. Each capsule can contain photos, videos, audio recordings, and written letters, with options for private or public accessibility. The platform supports collaboration, allowing multiple users to contribute to shared capsules. Key features include media upload and management, search functionality, user authentication (email/password and Google login), downloadable memories, and role-based collaboration. The project is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with additional libraries like JSZip for file compression and FileSaver.js for media downloads. LocalStorage is used to simulate a database for data persistence.

The website is structured into various HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, managing authentication, dashboard functionality, capsule creation, and search operations. The project is also dockerized for easy deployment. Challenges such as data persistence and media handling were addressed using localStorage and base64 encoding. Future enhancements include backend integration (MongoDB/Firebase), password hashing, email verification, advanced search, and improved responsiveness. The Memory Capsule Collection aims to provide a seamless and engaging user experience, making it a meaningful platform for preserving and sharing memories.
